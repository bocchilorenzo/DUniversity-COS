# Project domain
the general scope of the project concerns the University of Trento and in particular, information about the courses taught, the staff/teachers and the organizational structure. As far as time is concerned, the scope is the current academic year, since a potential user who is interested in the courses being taught looks for current and updated information rather than old, archived data. More precisely, the datasets will possibly be updated regularly and the period can be restricted between october 2022 and january 2023. The spatial scope can be expressed with the coordinates of the University of Trento. The problem is that the University has many departments in different places not only of Trento but also nearby cities/villages like Povo, Mesiano and Rovereto. Therefore, the coordinates chosen to represent it are the centroid of the coordinates of all the various departments, which has latitude 46.0626733 and longitude 11.12657322, with an average altitude of 272 meters.
# Purpose
A service which help the users to query and know about the different courses being taught at the University of Trento supported by its organizational structure.
